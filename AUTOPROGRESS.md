# CraftDefense Auto-Progress Log

## 2026-05-16 — Pistol + Sniper Rifle (Guns System)

### What was done (Run 1 — Pistol)
- Added **Pistol** as the first gun (hitscan, not projectile-based)
  - 12 damage per shot, 60-block range, 0.35s fire rate
  - Left-click to fire when pistol is active hotbar item
  - Distinct viewmodel: grip/slide/barrel geometry rendered on the arm
  - Sharp gunshot audio: bang + crack + metallic shell-casing tick
- Added **Bullet** ammo item (stackable ×64); crafted from iron ingot + gunpowder
- Added **Gunpowder** material; drops from Creepers (0.8 chance, 2 per kill)
- Pistol crafting recipe (3×3 workbench: iron ingots + stick)
- **Ammo counter HUD** in bottom-right when gun is equipped (⚙ N)
- Dry-click sound + brief cooldown when firing with no ammo
- Dungeon chest #3 pre-loaded with pistol + bullets for early discovery

### What was done (Run 2 — Sniper Rifle + TypeScript 6 Fix)
- **Fixed TypeScript 6.0 compatibility**: Changed `moduleResolution: "Node"` (deprecated in TS6) to `"bundler"` in both tsconfig files
- Added **`sniper_rifle`** weapon:
  - 28 damage, 60 range, 2.2s cooldown, consumes `sniper_ammo`
  - Right-click toggles sniper scope: FOV 75→20, dark circular scope overlay with green crosshairs
  - Scope auto-clears when switching hotbar slots
  - Bullet tracer line (yellow) shown on fire, impact sparks at hit point
  - Distinct long-barrel gun viewmodel (barrel + receiver + grip + scope rail)
  - Sounds: `sniper_fire` (loud crack) and `scope_in` (soft click)
- Added **`sniper_ammo`** (stackable x64, crafted: flint + iron_ingot = 8 rounds)
- Extended **ItemDef** with `weaponType`, `ammoType`, `gunRange`, `gunCooldown` fields
- **Architecture**: `ITEMS[id].weaponType === "gun"` → routes left-click to unified `tryGunFire(def)` in Game.ts
- Pistol uses `buildPistolMesh()`, sniper and future guns use `buildGunMesh(color)`
- `spawnBulletImpact()` in Particles.ts for impact sparks

### Dungeon loot updated
- One dungeon chest now spawns with: sniper_rifle + 16 ammo + pistol + 16 bullets

### Ideas for next run
- **Add Shotgun**: multiple raycasts in spread cone, very short range (12 blocks), uses `shotgun_shells`, pump-action sound
- **Add Crossbow**: charges with right-click (like bow), holds charge indefinitely, faster than bow, bolt projectile
- **Add Raygun**: exotic final weapon — hitscan chains to nearby enemies, uses `energy_cell`, crafted from diamond + gold
- Polish guns: muzzle flash particle at barrel tip for pistol, reload mechanic (magazine system)
- Ammo counter: update to show ammo for sniper too (not just pistol)

### Technical notes
- `window.__game` exposes running game instance for Playwright tests
- Playwright uses `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome` (executablePath override needed)
- TypeScript 6.0.2 requires `moduleResolution: "bundler"` (not `"Node"`)
- Both `pistolCooldown` and `gunCooldown` were present; consolidated to single `gunCooldown`
